                <p class="bg-text">Grammy Award winner Miles Davis was a major force in the jazz world, as both a trumpet player and a bandleader. It would not be a stretch to say that jazz would not look the way it does today without his contributions. His list of influences reached to many musicians and genres beyond jazz; funk, pop, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, and so on. </p>

In 1979, Davis rekindled his relation with actress Cicely Tyson who helped overcome his cocaine addiction and his love for music. They married in 1981, but were officially divorced in 1989.
